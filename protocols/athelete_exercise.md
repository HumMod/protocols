## Protocol
The subject undergoes 7 min submaximal (40-80% of maximal oxygen uptake) and 5 min maximal (80% maximal oxygen uptake) runs during a 2 day period.  For the first day, data is collected during the last two minutes of each run.  Let the subject rest lying down for the rest of the day. The subject has 10 minute rests between work loads unless specified otherwise.

During the second day, a small fat-free breakfast is served.  All runs are done on the treadmill.  After eating, the subject lays down rested for an hour before starting exercises.  The subject has 10 minute rests between work loads unless specified otherwise.  

For submaximal runs, assume 40% maximal oxygen uptake.  To obtain a 40% uptake on a bike, set power = 100 Watts with RPM = 55. On a treadmill, have the subject walk 3.5 MPH. For maximal runs, assume 80% maximal oxygen uptake.  On treadmill, run the subject at 6 MPH at 28% efficiency. 

### Day 1 Exercises
1. Run a 30 min rest to have the respiratory rate going
2. A Submaximal run on bicycle
3. Two submaximal runs on treadmill 
4. A maximal run on treadmill

### Day 2 Exercises
1. Three submaximal runs --> Data collected after 6th min of each run
2. 20 mins of rest after last run
3. 3 min warm up --> 50% maximal oxygen uptake (Walk at 4 MPH)
4. A maximal run --> Data collected after 3rd min
