## Protocol
Data points are collected for the last minute of each rest and exercise period.  Steps 1 through 5 are executed three hours after meals.  Subject is at own leisure whenever not actively participating in the protocol.  Subject is under controlled diet for four days prior to each iteration through the protocol.  The protocol is executed at sea-level and high-altitude (4,300 meters).

### Primary Trial
1. Rest for 120 minutes.
2. Bike for 20 minutes at 102 Watts (sea-level) / 69.5 Watt (high-altitude).
3. 60 minutes of rest.
4. Bike for 20 minutes at 173 Watts (sea-level) / 130 Watts (high-altitude).
5. 60 minutes of rest.

### High-Altitude Adjustments
- Maintain at altitude for 14 hours prior to starting primary trial on first day at high-altitude.
- Subject is maintained at altitude at their own leisure.
- On 11th day at altitude, repeat step 1 through 5.

### Environmental and Dietary Control
- 21 degrees Celsius at 30-40%
- 300g Carbs, 100g Pro, 67g Fat, 180mEq Na+, 80mEq K+, and 3L of H2O

## Variables of Interest
- Partial pressure of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide 
- Venous pH
- Hematocrit and hemoglobin
- Pulmonary ventilation
- Plasma aldosterone (ng/100ml), renin (ng/ml/hr), angiotensin II (pg/ml), cortisol (ug/100ml), ACTH (ug/100ml), and total catecholamines (ug/L)
- Urinary aldosterone (ug/g creatinine), potassium (mEq/24hr), and sodium (mEq/24hr)
- Weight (kg)
