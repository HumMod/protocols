# Human experimental model of hemorrhage
Summers, Richard L. et al., Resuscitation, 80(12), 2009.

## Protocol
Data is collected from the last minute of each lower external pressure change.  Every lower pressure change lasts 5 minutes.  

### Test Trial
1.  Start the subject at 0 mmHg lower external pressure 
2.  Go to -60 mmHg with increments of -15.
3.  After the patient reaches -60 mmHg, increase negative pressure by 10 
4.  Stop the lower pressure after the 5 minute run of -100 mmHg

## Variables to Record
- Lower External Pressure
- Cardiac Output
- Flow of Systemic Arteries
- Oxygen Saturation
